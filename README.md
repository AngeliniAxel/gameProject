I am creating a PERN stack application using typescript.

The idea is to create a web app with a game developed in phaser.js and using react for developing the interface and a login/registration system with node.js and postgres.

Users will be able to create account, personalize their character and save game level.

For now I only have the basic set up of the app and the registration route.

I will be updating this project any time soon!
