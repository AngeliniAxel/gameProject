I am creating a PERN stack application using typescript.

The idea is to create a web app with a game developed in phaser.js and using react for developing the interface and a login/registration system with node.js and postgres.

Users will be able to create account, personalize their character and save game level.

All the functionality of the login/register part of my app is created.

Next thing to do is design the aspect a little bit and then everything will be ready to start with the game!
